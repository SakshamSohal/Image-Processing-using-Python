# Geometrical-Shape-Detection-and-Recognition-in-Image-Processing
Developed a Python-based system for detecting and
recognizing various geometrical shapes in digital images using image processing
techniques. This involves preprocessing images, applying edge detection, contour detection,
and shape classification methods to identify shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and
rectangles.
